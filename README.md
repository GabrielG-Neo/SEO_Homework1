This project was mainly to push myself out of my comfort zone. I wanted to see not if I could complete this project, but to show myself what I am capable of when put to a challenge I would have otherwise never thought of doing. In completing this project I learned how to look at a web site and determine other ways to write code to make life easier in the future for myself and other developers who visit my code. In visiting my project, you will come across a web page. Not just any web page but one edited and recreated by ideas to enhance the visual and working elements of the page.
